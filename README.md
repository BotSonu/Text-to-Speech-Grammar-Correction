# Text-to-Speech and Grammar Correction  

This project is a **web-based application** that combines **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** functionality, **Grammar Correction**, a **Word Counter**, and a **Digital Clock**, all implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, without relying on any external APIs. The focus is on simplicity, accessibility, and offline usability.  

### Features:  
1. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts user input text to speech using native browser capabilities, such as the SpeechSynthesis API.  
2. **Grammar Correction**: Highlights grammatical errors in user input and suggests corrections, implemented through custom JavaScript logic.  
3. **Word Counter**: Counts the number of words in the input text, providing real-time feedback to the user.  
4. **Digital Clock**: Displays a live digital clock on the interface, dynamically updating in real time.  
5. **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly and accessible layout adaptable to various devices and screen sizes.  
6. **Offline Functionality**: The application runs entirely in the browser without requiring an internet connection or external dependencies.  

### Technology Stack:  
- **HTML**: For structuring the web application.  
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive, visually appealing layout.  
- **JavaScript**: For implementing dynamic features like TTS, grammar correction, word counting, and the clock.  

### Future Enhancements:  
1. **Enhanced Grammar Checking**: Improve grammar logic to handle more complex sentences and suggest detailed corrections.  
2. **TTS Customization**: Add options for pitch, speed, and voice selection in the Text-to-Speech feature.  
3. **Multilingual Support**: Extend functionality to support multiple languages for TTS, grammar correction, and word counting.  
4. **File Handling**: Allow users to upload text files for grammar correction or download corrected text/audio output.  
5. **Customizable Clock**: Add options to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats or display a calendar.  
6. **Theme Options**: Introduce light/dark mode or custom themes for better user experience.
